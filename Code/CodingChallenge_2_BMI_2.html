        // Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
        // improve it.
        // Your tasks:
        // 1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
        // is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
        // 2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
        // BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

        // Code here:
        let markMass = prompt("Enter Mark's mass in kg: ");
        let markHeight = prompt("Enter Mark's height in meter: ");
        let johnMass = prompt("Enter John's mass in kg: ");
        let johnHeight = prompt("Enter John's height in meter: ");

        let markBMI = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
        let johnBMI = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2;

        let markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI;

        if (markHigherBMI) {
            console.log(`Mark's BMI (${markBMI}) is higher than John's (${johnBMI})!`);
        } else {
            console.log(`John's BMI (${johnBMI}) is higher than Mark's (${markBMI})!`);
